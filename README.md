# chord-parser

Lately I've been interested in music theory. This project (a TypeScript/React app) is an attempt to translate some of the rules I'm learning about into code. 

I'm hoping to also build some useful utilities with this logic, like a chord finder which takes a combination of notes and lists possible chords that could harmonize with it, organized by diatonic and non-diatonic, as well as information based on functional harmony to help you choose the best the fit.
